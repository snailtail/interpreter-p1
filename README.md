## Crafting interpreters part 1

From the online book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html)  
Trying out part 1, where the interpreter is built with Java.  
I'm going to try to implement it using C# and .NET 8

| 20240807 | Added support for literals |
| 20240806 | Continuing at 4.6.1, also added a .NET 8 project |
| 20240802 | Created Dev Container for Java and started on the real Lox project |
